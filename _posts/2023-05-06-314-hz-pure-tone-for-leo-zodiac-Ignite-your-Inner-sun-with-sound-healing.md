## Why 314 Hz Aligns with Leo‚Äôs Fiery Energy

As a fire sign, your energy is bold, dynamic, and magnetic. But when overstimulated, that same fire can lead to burnout, stubbornness, or ego clashes.

**The Science of Sound:**  
- **Musical Note E (Mi):** Linked to clarity and vitality, the note E resonates with the Solar Plexus, amplifying courage and self-expression.  
- **A Frequency for Balance:** 314 Hz is believed to stabilize extremes‚Äîthink passion without impulsivity, leadership without dominance.
