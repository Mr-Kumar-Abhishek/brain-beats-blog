This frequency serves as a sonic sanctuary for Gemini, providing a tranquil space for meditation, balance, and relaxation.

#### The Science Behind 282 Hz

The frequency of 282 Hz is not just a random number; it is a specific vibration that aligns with the energy of Gemini. This tone is a fundamental pitch that can influence the mind and body in profound ways. Research has shown that specific frequencies can have therapeutic effects on the human body.
