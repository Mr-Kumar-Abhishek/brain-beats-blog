Astral projection is a fascinating concept that has captured the imagination of many. It refers to an out-of-body experience where the astral body separates from the physical body and is capable of traveling outside it throughout the universe. The idea of astral travel has been present in many cultures and is often associated with meditative and trance states.

In the realm of astral projection, binaural beats and Solfeggio frequencies are tools that can potentially assist individuals in achieving the various stages of this experience. Binaural beats involve playing two slightly different frequencies in each ear, which the brain perceives as a single new frequency. This phenomenon can influence brainwave patterns and, as some believe, facilitate a state conducive to astral projection.

The process of astral projection through binaural beats can be understood in phases, each with its own set of frequencies designed to aid in specific aspects of the experience:

1. **Detachment from the Physical Body (Flavor 1)**
   - Phase 1: 4 Hz binaural beats over 852 Hz Solfeggio frequency
   - Phase 2: 4 Hz binaural beats over 963 Hz Solfeggio frequency

These frequencies aim to help the individual achieve a total detachment from the physical body, which is considered the first stage of astral projection.

2. **Mental Vision and Astral Projection Vision (Flavor 2)**
   - Phase 1: 6.30 Hz binaural beats over 852 Hz Solfeggio frequency
   - Phase 2: 6.30 Hz binaural beats over 963 Hz Solfeggio frequency

Once detached, these settings are believed to provide sensory inputs from the astral realm, enhancing the projection experience.

3. **Delicate Tasks in the Astral Realm (Flavor 3)**
   - Phase 1: 7 Hz binaural beats over 852 Hz Solfeggio frequency
   - Phase 2: 7 Hz binaural beats over 963 Hz Solfeggio frequency

These frequencies may allow for more intricate activities such as astral psychic surgery and manipulating objects within the astral plane.

4. **Sparring in the Astral Realm (Flavor 4)**
   - Phase 1: 27 Hz over 852 Hz Solfeggio frequency
   - Phase 2: 27 Hz over 963 Hz Solfeggio frequency

This stage is said to assist with more dynamic interactions in the astral realm, such as sparring.

5. **Focused Thinking and Planning (Flavor 5)**
   - Phase 1: 63 Hz over 852 Hz Solfeggio frequency
   - Phase 2: 63 Hz over 963 Hz Solfeggio frequency

At this level, the frequencies are designed to enhance cognitive functions like planning and problem-solving while in the astral state.

6. **Manifesting from the Astral to the Physical (Flavor 6)**
   - Phase 1: 70 Hz over 852 Hz Solfeggio frequency
   - Phase 2: 70 Hz over 963 Hz Solfeggio frequency

The final phase involves frequencies that some believe can help manifest experiences or objects from the astral realm into physical reality. Keep in mind that this preset can't be made in binaural beats as it's above its capacity, so use monaural beats, isochronic tones or square wave monaural beats

While the scientific community remains skeptical about the efficacy of binaural beats for astral projection, many practitioners and enthusiasts continue to explore these frequencies as a means to expand their consciousness and explore the astral plane. It's important to approach these practices with an open mind, but also a critical one, understanding that personal experiences can vary greatly.

For those interested in experimenting with binaural beats and Solfeggio frequencies for astral projection, it is recommended to do so in a safe, quiet environment, preferably with guidance from someone experienced in meditation and astral travel. Remember, the journey within is as significant as the destination. Happy travels on your astral adventures!
