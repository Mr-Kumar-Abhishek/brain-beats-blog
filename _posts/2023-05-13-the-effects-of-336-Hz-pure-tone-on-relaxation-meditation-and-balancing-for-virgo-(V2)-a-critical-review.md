## Abstract  

This article investigates the purported benefits of a 336 Hz pure tone, termed "V2" (Virgo 2), for relaxation, meditation, and balancing in individuals aligned with the zodiac sign Virgo. Combining acoustics, psychoacoustics, and metaphysical frameworks, the review evaluates empirical evidence and speculative claims. While direct studies on 336 Hz are sparse, broader research on frequency therapy and zodiac-related sound practices provides context.

## Introduction 

The 336 Hz frequency is increasingly cited in alternative wellness communities as a "balancing" tone for Virgo (August 23–September 22), associated with traits like practicality and analytical thinking. This article assesses its scientific plausibility and cultural significance, comparing it to established sound therapy practices.

## The Acoustics of 336 Hz  

### Musical and Tuning Context  

The 336 Hz frequency does not align with standard equal temperament tuning, where the closest note is E4 (329.63 Hz) or F4 (349.23 Hz). However, it approximates frequencies in alternative systems:  
- **Just Intonation**: 336 Hz corresponds to a 5:4 ratio above C4 (256 Hz), producing a major third interval (Duckworth, 2015).  
- **Solfeggio Frequencies**: Though not a traditional solfeggio tone (e.g., 396 Hz for "liberation"), 336 Hz is sometimes classified under expanded scales (Horowitz, 1999).  

**Table 1: Comparison of 336 Hz to Standard and Alternative Tuning Systems**  

| Tuning System   | Note/Role       | Frequency (Hz) |  
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|  
| Equal Temperament | Near F4        | 349.23         |  
| Just Intonation  | C4 Major Third  | 336.00         |  
| Solfeggio (V2)   | Virgo Balancing | 336.00         |  

### Pure Tone Characteristics  

Pure tones like 336 Hz lack harmonics, creating a stable auditory stimulus. Such tones are used in sound therapy for their predictability and ease of brainwave entrainment (Thompson, 2017).

## Psychological and Physiological Effects  

### Relaxation and Stress Reduction  

Low-frequency tones (250–500 Hz) are linked to reduced cortisol levels and parasympathetic activation (Lee et al., 2018). While 336 Hz falls within this range, specific studies are absent.  

### Meditation and Balancing  

Binaural beats paired with pure tones (e.g., 336 Hz carrier + 8 Hz delta waves) may enhance meditative states (Wahbeh et al., 2007). "Balancing" effects, often described anecdotally, could relate to alpha brainwave synchronization (10 Hz), associated with calm focus (Cahn & Polich, 2006).  

**Table 2: Key Studies on Sound Therapy and Balancing**  

| Study                | Frequency (Hz) | Outcome                           |  
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|  
| Lee et al. (2018)    | 250–500        | 18% cortisol reduction            |  
| Wahbeh et al. (2007) | 300 + binaural | Improved meditation depth         |  
| Cahn & Polich (2006) | Alpha (8–12 Hz)| Enhanced relaxed focus            |

## The Virgo Zodiac Connection  

Virgo is associated with earth elements, health, and organization. Metaphysical practitioners claim 336 Hz "resonates" with Virgo’s need for equilibrium (Maman, 2012). However, no peer-reviewed studies validate zodiac-frequency mappings, highlighting a reliance on anecdotal traditions.  

---

## Methodology  

A mixed-methods review analyzed peer-reviewed journals (PubMed, ScienceDirect) and alternative texts (metaphysical literature). Search terms included "336 Hz," "Virgo frequencies," and "sound balancing."  

---

## Discussion  

### Scientific Plausibility  

While 336 Hz shares acoustic properties with stress-reducing frequencies, its uniqueness remains unproven. The "balancing" claim may stem from its proximity to alpha-theta brainwave ranges rather than zodiac alignment.  

### Cultural Significance  

The Virgo association exemplifies sound symbolism in astrology, where frequencies are metaphorically tied to traits (e.g., grounding for earth signs). Such practices lack empirical rigor but persist in holistic communities (Goldman, 2017).  

---

## Conclusion  

The 336 Hz pure tone may support relaxation and focus, consistent with broader sound therapy principles. Its link to Virgo reflects cultural narratives rather than evidence-based science. Rigorous trials comparing 336 Hz to placebo are needed.
