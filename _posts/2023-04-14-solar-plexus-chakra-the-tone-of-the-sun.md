The **Solar Plexus Chakra**, also known as **Manipura**, is located slightly below the solar plexus. It is associated with the color yellow-green and is linked to our sense of self, personal power, and will. This chakra governs our digestive system, metabolism, and overall vitality.

## **The Frequency of the Sun**

At a frequency of **126.22 Hz**, the Solar Plexus Chakra resonates with the tone of the Sun itself. The Sun serves as a powerful transmitter and receiver of energies between Earth and the Cosmos. It represents the zero point or stillness in all cycles‚Äîa point from which everything emanates.

### **Attributes and Effects**

- **Focus:** The 126.22 Hz frequency enhances our ability to concentrate and focus our intentions.
- **Will Power:** It empowers our willpower, determination, and drive.
- **Action:** This tone encourages us to take decisive action in alignment with our purpose.

## **The Multidimensional Experience**

The frequency of the Sun is unique because it does not follow the usual pattern of raising astronomical periods to higher octaves. It remains at its original level, much like absolute temperature zero‚Äîthe limit of expansion and contraction. In this sense, it represents a gravitational length.

Advanced practitioners who have worked with other chakra tones can explore new dimensions using this frequency. Experiences become multidimensional, catapulting us into uncharted realms of existence.

## **Healing Potential**

While the medicinal effects are not yet fully explored, this tone holds promise for addressing digestive disorders, intestinal issues, food allergies, poor metabolism, diabetes, obesity, skin conditions (such as eczema and acne), lack of memory, concentration difficulties, insomnia, and eating disorders.

Remember that even small positive actions can ripple across the universe. As you explore this Solar Plexus Chakra frequency, may it contribute positively to your well-being.
